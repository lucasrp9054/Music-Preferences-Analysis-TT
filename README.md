# Music-Preferences-Analysis-TT
This project, part of the TripleTen Data Science bootcamp, introduces the data analyst's workflow, from initial data exploration to hypothesis testing. Using a dataset from an online music streaming service, the objective was to analyze and compare the user behavior in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville to validate or reject a hypothesis.
